### C#
- There's two kinds of datatypes in C#
    - ValueType: Stored directly in Stack. Structures go here.
    - ReferenceType: Stack contains reference to data. Actual data lives somewhere else. Classes go here.
    - C# does not allow working with pointers. But it does contain pointers.

- Classes can access members of other classes within their package depending on the access modifiers specified.
    - private, protected, internal, private and internal protected


**Do not print stuff directly from inside class objects. Use getter methods and print from either a printer class or the main method**
